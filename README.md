# Diabetes Prediction

This project provides a diabetes prediction model using machine learning techniques. The model is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook or Colab Notebook and utilizes a CSV dataset for training and testing.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Python 3 installed on your machine.
2. Jupyter Notebook or access to a Colab Notebook.

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/theakashshukla/Diabetes-Prediction.git
```

2. Change to the project's directory:

```shell
cd DiabetesPrediction 
```


3. Install the required dependencies using pip:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## Usage

Follow these steps to run the Diabetes Prediction notebook:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Colab Notebook.

2. Upload the dataset file (`diabetes.csv`) to the notebook environment. You can find the dataset in the `data` directory of the project.

3. Open the `DiabetesPrediction.ipynb` notebook.

4. In the notebook, locate the section where the dataset is loaded. If necessary, update the file path to match the location of your uploaded `diabetes.csv` file.

5. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to execute the code and train the model.

6. Once the model training is complete, you can use it to make predictions or perform evaluations as specified in the notebook.

7. Feel free to explore and modify the notebook to suit your needs.
